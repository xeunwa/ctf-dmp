Pity, in place of love,			       	       			  
That pettiest of gifts,      	     	    		      	       	       
Is but a sugar-coating over neglect. 		 	   	  	 
Any passerby can make a gift of it 	  	   	  	   	       
To a street beggar,   	    	       		    	     	  	   
Only to forget the moment the first corner is turned.   	 
I had not hoped for anything more that day.	 	      		   
       	  	   	 	      	  	  	   	       	      
You left during the last watch of night.   		  		 
I had hoped you would say goodbye,     	   	     	 	     	 
Just say ‘Adieu’ before going away,  	 
What you had said another day,
What I shall never hear again.
In their place, just that one word,
Bound by the thin fabric of a little compassion
Would even that have been too much for you to bear?

When I first awoke from sleep
My heart fluttered with fear
Lest the time had been over.
I rushed out of bed.
The distant church clock chimed half past twelve
I sat waiting near the door of my room
Resting my head against it,
Facing the porch through which you would come out.
